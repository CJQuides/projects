      <h2><b><i>What is Covid 19?</i></b></h2>

      <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
        Covid 19 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people
        infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring
        special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those
        with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer
        are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at
        any age.
      </p>

      <h2><b><i>What can GRQV - PH do?</i></b></h2>

      <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
        GRQV - PH will help people to be more aware of other people’s side effects, which will be beneficial to those
        who have not been vaccinated. Users can also access the website at any time and from any location to learn more
        about the COVID - 19 vaccine’s post - side effects. In terms of credibility, the information through this
        website is eligible because the users are the ones that shared their experience after they take that kind of
        vaccine.

          <li>The vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. Available data shows that
            symptomatic reinfection is unlikely in these persons for up to 6 months after natural infection.
            Consequently, they may choose to delay vaccination to nearer the end of this period, especially when vaccine
            supply is limited. In settings where variants of concerns with evidence of immune escape are circulating
            earlier immunization after infection may be advisable.</li>

        <hr>
        <p style="font-size: 100%;">
          In most situations, Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are preferred over the J&J/Janssen COVID-19
          vaccine for primary and booster vaccination due to the risk of serious adverse events. Vaccine recipients must
          be informed of the risks and benefits of J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccination. The J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine
          may be considered in some situations, including for persons who:
          <li>Had a severe reaction after an mRNA vaccine dose or who have a severe allergy to an ingredient of
            Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna (mRNA COVID-19 vaccines).</li>
          <li>Would otherwise remain unvaccinated for COVID-19 due to limited access to Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna (mRNA
            COVID-19 vaccines).</li>

            not severe, to any ingredientexternal icon in the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (such as polysorbate), you
            should not get the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.</li>
          <li>A severe allergic reaction is one that needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen or requiring

          <li>The vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. Within 6 months after an initial
            natural infection, available data show that symptomatic reinfection is uncommon. Given limited vaccine
            supply, persons with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the preceding 6 months may therefore choose to
            delay vaccination until near the end of this period. In settings where variants of concerns with evidence of
            immune escape are circulating earlier immunization after infection may be advisable.</li>
          <li>Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in lactating women as in other adults. WHO recommends the
            use of the COVID-19 vaccine BIBP in lactating women as in other adults. WHO does not recommend discontinuing
            breastfeeding after vaccination.</li>

            Persons living with HIV were not included in the trial but given this is a non-replicating vaccine, persons
            living with HIV who are a part of the recommended group for vaccination may be vaccinated. Information and
